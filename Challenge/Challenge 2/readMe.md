#### Goal : Create method to get incomplete task.

- Define getTasksToDo method.
- Use filter to return just the incomplete tasks ( arrow functions)
- Test your work  by running the script

```javascript
const tasks = {
    tasks: [{
        text: 'Grocery Shopping' ,
        completed: true
    }, {
        text: 'Clean Yard' ,
        completed: false
    }, {
        text: 'Film Course',
        completed: true
    }]

}
console.log(tasks.getTasksToDo())
````
